# CS348K (Mini-) Assignment 2: <br/> Optimizing a Convolutional Layer in Halide #

In this assignment you will implement optimize the performance of code to evaluate a convolutional layer in a DNN. 
Implementing a conv layer [is easy](http://cs348k.stanford.edu/spring20/lecture/dnneval/slide_024) (we give you the algorithm in Halide in the starter code). The challenge is implementing the layer efficiently using the techniques described in class, such as SIMD vector processing, multi-core execution, and efficient blocking for cache locality. 

**You are allowed to use the reference Halide algorithm provided in the codebase verbatim** (see `StudentConvLayerGenerator` in `conv_layer_generators.cpp`). However, to improve the performance you will need to write an efficient Halide schedule. The starter code uses a naive/default Halide schedule, which corresponds to an evaluate order equivalent to code with loops that look like:

```
  // Initialization
  for n:
    for z:
      for y:
        for x:
          conv(...) = ...
  // Updates
  for n:
    for z:
      for y:
        for x:
          for r0:
            for r1:
              for r2:
                conv(...) = ...
```

Your job is to implement a custom Halide schedule that performs better than the default. (See [`Halide::Func::print_loop_nest()`](http://halide-lang.org/docs/class_halide_1_1_func.html#a365488c2eaf769c61635120773e541e1) to inspect and debug your schedule like this.) # Resources and documentation # * [Halide tutorials](http://halide-lang.org/tutorials/tutorial_introduction.html). In particular, see Tutorial 01 for a basic introduction, Tutorial 07 for a convolution example, and Tutorial 05 for an introduction to Halide schedules, and Tutorial 08 for more advanced scheduling topics.  * [Exhaustive Halide documentation](http://halide-lang.org/docs/).  # Assignment mechanics # Grab the assignment starter code.  git clone git@github.com:stanford-cs348k/asst2-convlayer.git __Build Instructions__

The codebase uses a simple `Makefile` as the build system. However, there is a dependency on Halide.

To build the starter code, run `make` from the top level directory. The driver source code is in `src/`, and object files and binaries will be populated in `build/` and `bin/` respectively. The implementation of the convolution layer generator you will modify is in the top-level file `conv_layer_generators.cpp`.

To install and use Halide follow the instructions at http://halide-lang.org/. In particular, you should [download a binary release of Halide](https://github.com/halide/Halide/releases). Once you've downloaded and untar'd the release, say into directory `halide_dir`, change the previous lines back, and also the following line in `Makefile`

    HALIDE_DIR=/MY/PATH/TO/HALIDE

to

    HALIDE_DIR=<halide_dir>

Then you can build the code using the instructions above.

__Running the starter code:__

To get help run:
    ./bin/convlayer -h

To run your scheduled conv layer try:
    ./bin/convlayer --schedule student

This code will run your version of the convolution layer using randomly generated inputs and weights. It will run for 3 trials, and report the minimum time of the 3 runs.
To run correctly you must ensure that
Halide is in your library load path. On OSX this can be done like so:

    DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=<halide_dir>/bin ./bin/convlayer <args>

and on Linux it will be:

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<halide_dir>/bin ./bin/convlayer <args>

__Modifying the code__

Your modifications to the code should only go in the file `conv_layer_generators.cpp`. Inside that file you should not modify the implementation of the convolution layer algorithm. You should only add Halide scheduling directives to the program to make it run faster. Regions you should modify will be marked by comments that look like so:

    // BEGIN: CS348K STUDENTS MODIFY THIS CODE
    
    // END: CS348K STUDENTS MODIFY THIS CODE

We have provided a reference implementation in `conv_layer_generators.cpp` called `DefaultConvLayerGenerator`. The code generated by `DefaultConvLayerGenerator` is called `HalideConvolutionLayer` in source file `./src/default_convolution_layer.cpp`. You can use any of the code in these files for your implementation. In particular, you can copy the Halide algorithm (and just provide a custom schedule).
